Automatic timeslot booking script for a well known hungarian online food ordering service

Desperate times ask for desperate measures.
Due to the low amount of free timeslots available for ordering food on one of the well known hungarian food ordering services available,
I've decided to write a small and ugly script to automatically book a fee timeslot when it comes available, and send a warning sound
in the form of a YouTube video.

NOTES:
- mak sure the downloaded webdriver is compatible with your current chrome webbrowser. The included one is for chrome v.81.0.4 (latest as of 2020.04.15.)
